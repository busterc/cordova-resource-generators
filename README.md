# cordova-resource-generators
<!--Cordova generators for app icons and splash screens (can be used as hooks, or not)-->
Quickly generate mobile app icons and splash screens for Cordova builds and have them automatically copied to the appropriate `/platforms/*` directories.

* You must have [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/) installed
* Doesn't use or provide hooks, because I personally don't need to generate on every build (make hooks if you need them)
* Creates a `/resources/` directory as a sibling to `/www/` rather than beneath it
* Also copies icons and splash screens from `/resources/` to the appropriate `/platforms/*` directories (or will create the directory, if the commands are not run from the root of your app)
* Currently only generates iOS and Android resources
* Currently only tested on OS X
* Made for Cordova 3.4 and newer
* Use aliases, if that's your thang

## Version

## Installation on OS X
